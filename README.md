# POS-Tagger

## Training
Train the model using a pair of text files with one containing sentences and the other containing the matching part of speech of the words.

## Testing
After training, pass a file with sentences and it will output the part of speech of every word. Alternatively, pass sentences in through the command line to see the matching part of speech.
